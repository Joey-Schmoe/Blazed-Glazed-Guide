                    <p>Go through the name choice and the starting scene like most games. After finishing that you will be at the end of a path. Walk south a little bit and Luke (You don't know him yet.) will speak to you and teleport you into your house.</p>
                    
                    <p>Go outside where your mom and dad will talk to you. Head over to Willow's lab and choose one of the 5 starters! (it is advised against getting a Piplup as soon after you will have a mandatory battle with a Pikachu) </p>
